# Unattended Upgrades

Ubuntu is performing unattended upgrades by default and they are configured to run daily. Engine Yard has decided to disable unattended upgrades.

In order to enable them, you have to set the environment variable `EY_ENABLE_UNATTENDED_UPGRADES` to `"true"` for any environment you want unattended upgrades enabled.

The `Unattended Upgrades` recipe is managed by Engine Yard.

We accept contributions for changes that can be used by all customers.
