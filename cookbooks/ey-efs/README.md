# EFS

This recipe is used to configure EFS on the stable-v6 stack. When EFS is configured on an environment it currently puts the mount on all instances in the environment for your convenience. The mountpoint and shared folder can be updated in the attributes file named efs if /efs/shared is not the folder name you want to use.

The EFS recipe is managed by Engine Yard.

We accept contributions for changes that can be used by all customers.
