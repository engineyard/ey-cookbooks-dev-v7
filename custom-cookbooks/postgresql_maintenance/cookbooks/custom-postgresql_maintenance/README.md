# custom-postgresql_maintenance

This is a wrapper cookbook around Engine Yard's `ey-postgresql_maintenance` cookbook. Currently this recipe consists of setting up a vacuumdb cron job for a PostgreSQL database that can be customized to a specific application need (see below). This recipe may be updated in the future to support additional maintenance options.


Dependencies
--------------------------

These recipes are designed and build for use with PostgreSQL.




## Installation

For simplicity, we recommend that you create the cookbooks directory at the root
of your application. If you prefer to keep the infrastructure code separate from
application code, you can create a new repository.

Our main cookbook have the `ey-postgresql_maintenance` cookbook but it is not included by default.
To use the `ey-postgresql_maintenance` cookbook, you should copy this cookbook, `custom-postgresql_maintenance`.
You should not copy the actual `postgresql_maintenance` recipe. That is managed by Engine
Yard.

1. Edit `cookbooks/ey-custom/recipes/after-main.rb` and add

  ```
  include_recipe 'custom-postgresql_maintenance'
  ```

2. Edit `cookbooks/ey-custom/metadata.rb` and add

  ```
  depends 'custom-postgresql_maintenance'
  ```

3. Copy `custom-cookbooks/packages/cookbooks/custom-postgresql_maintenance` to `cookbooks/`

  ```
  cd ~ # Change this to your preferred directory. Anywhere but inside the application

  git clone https://github.com/engineyard/ey-cookbooks-stable-v7
  cd ey-cookbooks-stable-v7
  cp custom-cookbooks/packages/cookbooks/custom-postgresql_maintenance /path/to/app/cookbooks/
  ```

4. Download the ey-core gem on your local machine and upload the recipes

  ```
  gem install ey-core
  ey-core recipes upload --environment=<nameofenvironment> --file=<pathtocookbooksfilder> --apply
  ```

VacuumDB
--------------------------

Your database is configured by default with autovacuum but minimizes resources to this process to prevent it from negatively impacting application performance. Databases that see regular heavy load, or lots of writes and deletes may need regular manual vacuum operations globally or for specific tables.

The default action for the recipe will set up a weekly vacuum of all databases on the server at midnight Saturday night/Sunday morning server time.

Additional information on vacuum operation can be found in the PostgreSQL Manual: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/sql-vacuum.html.

## Customizations

All customizations go to `cookbooks/custom-postgresql_maintenance/attributes/default.rb`.

```
default["postgresql_maintenance"]["vacuumdb_cron_minute"] = "0"
default["postgresql_maintenance"]["vacuumdb_cron_hour"] = "0"
default["postgresql_maintenance"]["vacuumdb_cron_day"] = "*"
default["postgresql_maintenance"]["vacuumdb_cron_month"] = "*"
default["postgresql_maintenance"]["vacuumdb_cron_weekday"] = "0"

# this will vacuum all dbs
default["postgresql_maintenance"]["vacuumdb_command"] = "/usr/bin/vacuumdb -U postgres --all"
```
