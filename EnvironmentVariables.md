# Configuration Via Environment Variables

Many features in an Engine Yard Cloud stable-v6 environment can now be enabled
and configured via [environment variables](https://support.cloud.engineyard.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007661794).

This makes working with the Engine Yard Cloud platform much easier and 
removes the need for custom Chef recipes in many cases.

A list of supported settings is documented in the next section.
If you are missing a setting, please request it by [opening a GitHub issue](https://github.com/engineyard/ey-cookbooks-stable-v7/issues/new).

## Contribution Guidelines

The usual [contribution guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) apply.

Additionally, please adhere to the following specific rules:
1. Use the `fetch_env_var` helper in `cookbooks/ey-lib/libraries/env_vars.rb`
2. Add "enabled" flags logic to `cookbooks/ey-base/recipes/custom.rb`
3. Binary flags need to match against `/^TRUE$/i`
4. Make sure the default core cookbooks attributes are sensible defaults
5. Introduce additional variables to configure **important** settings as you see fit
6. Keep the naming of the variables consistent
   1. Variables must be prefixed with `EY_`
   2. Variable names should be declarative in nature (`EY_SOMETHING_ENABLED` rather than `EY_ENABLE_SOMETHING`)
7. Document every new variable introduced in the [section above](#supported-variables).
   If the variable needs further documentation, put it in a separate file and link to it from the description column
